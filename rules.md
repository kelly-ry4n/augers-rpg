#Basics
Characters have a few stats. You improve them in the skill tree.


Khan: Used to cast Auger skills. Ex: 10/10
Essence: Used to cast Gifted Skills: Ex: 800/800
Physical: Used to test physical and skilled tasks Ex: 3d6
Speed: How Far you can go. Ex: 4
Wounds: How much abuse you take before falling unconcious


When you reach 0 wounds you are unconscious.


Start every fight with essence and Khan full.
If you have healing, start every fight with max wounds. Else, carry wounds forward


#Items
Switching/equiping items or gear is an action


Sword: d6 
Dagger: 2d6, foe also hits you
Polearm: d6, -2 speed
Bow: d6, 10 range, firing provokes AoO
Crossbow: d6, 15 range, separate load/fire actions
Flintlock Rifle: 3d6, once per combat
Shield: Block one wound per round
Heavy Armor: Block 5 wounds (total),  Movement -4
Actions


Each action can be used to:
* Move your speed
* Use a skill
* Attack with your weapon
* coup de grace an unconscious foe
* Opposed Physical Actions
   * Roll your physical against theirs
* Unopposed Physical actions
   * Trivial: 0 successes
   * Interesting: 1 success
   * Probably a bad idea: 2 successes
   * That would certainly kill a mook: 3 successes
   * Legendary action: 4 successes


Attacking is done as a dice pool. Each success deals 1 wound.


So attacking with a dagger means you threaten 2 wounds, if both of your d6 come up as 5 or 6.


Attacking with a dagger with Weapons Training 1 threatens 6 wounds, meaning you roll 6d6.


Using Khan or Essence abilities typically work similarly. You will buy threat dice for points, and need to get successes greater than your foes Khan or Essence resist.


For example, to use Reading 1 on a foe with 2 Khan resist, you need to buy enough dice to get two successes. You decide this is worth using 4 dice. You mark off 4 from your current Khan and roll 4 dice.


If those dice have at least 2 successes, you use the ability successfully.


Movement out of threat of a melee attack provokes AoO


AoOs are a single wound risk.




#Generally speaking, 


* Khan is for getting you more actions and messing with enemy plans
* Essence is for mook killing blasts, shields and heals
* Education is for knowing things about whatever you encounter and resisting Khan
* Physical is for staying alive and damaging stronger foes


* You will need the heft of the Physical tree's big dice pools to do damage to powerful foes!
* Due to the lack of AoE in the physical tree, it is inefficient to use against mooks
* Mooks in large numbers will easily kill you! 
   * Use Essence and Khan to stop from getting cornered and poked to death
* Use Essence to take strategic advantages away from foes, like archers and cover!
* Use Khan to amplify the other two trees greatly, and mess with enemy plans
* Combat will be rough, if you don't play smart you'll lose
